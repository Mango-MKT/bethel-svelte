## Epiphyllum oxypetalum

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyllum_oxypetalum

<em>Told by <b>Beatriz Kanzki</b></em>

When we moved to our new house in Bouthillier in Haiti, there was one growing right at the edge of the wall. And without the flower, the plant looks like a very ugly thick stem with nothing on it.

So at first we didn't know what it was so my mother tried pulling it out of the wall. nothing... cutting it off, and it still grew back uglier then before, I even tied it to the back of my dad's motorcycle to pull it out of the wall, yet my cousin who was on the motorcycle almost came off of it and the plant still remained!

So my mother, myself and my brother we just let it be as there was nothing that would kill that plant.

One day the plant started to have red things that looked like Alien things, so I wanted to cut them, but my mother told me to leave it as if the motorcycle didn't pull it out of the wall there isn't much that will. Just leave it and see.

The following night we came back from a pizzeria around 11 pm and the first spectacle that appeared to us was the flower of that plant. And me to tell my mom, isn't that the plant we tried to kill, she's like "Yes!".

When we came out of the car there was a very desirable smell and the flower was 30 cm in diameter and was so stunning that we actually pulled a chair out to stair at it for an hour. We then never tried to kill it again.

### Application

The second application that I saw in this is that all of us, if we are rooted in the truth, there is nothing that will separate us from Jehovah, and just like promised trials don't last, and we can reflect jehovah's glory with the beautiful qualities that come from the spirit that are desirable to our brothers like that stunning flower. Now have a look and think about it.
