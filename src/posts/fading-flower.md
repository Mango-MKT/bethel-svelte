## Epiphyllum oxypetalum

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyllum_oxypetalum

Epiphyllum oxypetalum, the Dutchman's pipe cactus,[3] princess of the night or queen of the night,[4] is a species of cactus with a native range from Mexico to Nicaragua.[5] It blooms nocturnally, and its flowers wilt before dawn.

### Application

Queen of the night because it blooms only between 10 pm and 5 AM and dies the next day.

You could liken it to what this world offers, it looks nice for the moment but just like the flower it's life span can be very short.
